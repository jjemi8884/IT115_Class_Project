# Introduction
A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in your open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group. It is convention to capitalize the word "contributing" as the file title, and to save it as a resource in markdown (hence the extension .md).

## This file is for

Project owners - creators and maintiners of the file
Project contributors - users of the file who want to know items they're welcome to tackle, and tact they need in navigating the project/respecting those involved with the project
Project consumers - users who want to build off the project to create their own project

## Instructions

2. If you alter the title/index pages, please create a seperate branch and submit a pull request to allow atleast on other person to verify the work.
