# Introduction
A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in your open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group. It is convention to capitalize the word "contributing" as the file title, and to save it as a resource in markdown (hence the extension .md).

## This file is for

Project owners - creators and maintiners of the file
Project contributors - users of the file who want to know items they're welcome to tackle, and tact they need in navigating the project/respecting those involved with the project
Project consumers - users who want to build off the project to create their own project

## Instructions
1. To contrubute to this repository you are free to work within your own "HTML" page on the main branch. 
2. If you alter the title/index pages, please create a seperate branch and submit a pull request to allow at least on other person to verify the work.
3. To change pictures, use a seperate branch and pull request.

## How to report a bug
1. If a webpage doesn't load up properly, do not try to change and fix the code directly by yourself. 
2. First and foremost, inform it to all group members. Once the bug is discovered, write in detail (what the problem is and how the expected results is supposed to be)
3. For resolution: create a seperate branch, identify the bug, fix the bug and you must do this through a pull request.
